# phishing-domain-detection-

This project presents a machine learning-based solution for detecting phishing domains, leveraging PyCaret's classification module to efficiently classify websites as either legitimate or malicious. Phishing attacks, which aim to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, continue to be a major cybersecurity threat. Our solution aims to tackle this problem by automatically identifying phishing domains in real-time.

Methodology
In this project, we employ a robust machine learning pipeline using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library, to streamline the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. We start by collecting a dataset of domain names and their features, then apply feature engineering and preprocessing steps to ensure the data is ready for training. Various classification models are tested, and the best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature extraction, and data normalization.
Model Training: Training multiple machine learning classifiers to identify phishing domains.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable detection.
Key Features:
High Accuracy: Achieving excellent classification performance for distinguishing between phishing and legitimate domains.
Real-Time Application: The model can be used for real-time phishing detection in cybersecurity applications.
Easy Deployment: Using PyCaretâ€™s simple API, models can be quickly deployed into production environments.
This approach demonstrates the power of machine learning in real-world cybersecurity problems and highlights how automation can greatly improve phishing detection accuracy. Future improvements can focus on optimizing the model and expanding the dataset for broader real-world application.
